Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the user attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback to the user on whether their guess is too high or too low.

Features

-Levels: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard with distinct ranges and attempts.
-Timer: Countdown timer adds pressure to make guesses within a time limit.
-Dynamic UI: Background image resizing and level-specific color schemes enhance user experience.
-Game Controls: Start, reset, and submit buttons manage game flow and interaction.
-Feedback: Real-time updates on guesses, attempts remaining, and game outcomes.

Technologies Used

-Python: Primary programming language for game logic and UI.
-Tkinter: Python library for building the graphical user interface.
-PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for dynamic background resizing.
-Additional technologies as applicable based on developer's expertise.

Usage

-Select Level: Choose difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
-Start Game: Begin guessing within the specified range.
-Submit Guess: Input your guess and receive immediate feedback.
-Timer: Monitor countdown and attempt to guess before time expires.

Dependencies

-Python 3.x
-Tkinter (included in standard Python distribution)
-PIL (Python Imaging Library)

How to Run
-Clone the repository to your local machine.
-Navigate to the project directory.
